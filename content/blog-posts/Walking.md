I'm really excited about the X-wing Miniatures Phoenix Cell Squadron Pack that was released this month. I've watched Rebels through a couple of times now and since then have been wanting to do a repaint of my CR90. I've never done a repaint to any of my X-wing Miniatures, so why not start with a repair, repaint and custom parts. What could go wrong?

My CR90 has seen better days. It's fallen off the shelf a couple of times. The stand pegs broke off. And the paint was scratched a bit. First up was disassembling the model. I wanted to break the model into as many parts as possible for the repaint. Fortunately it's pretty easy.

1. Put the model in the freezer for 2 hours. This makes the glue the factory uses to become brittle.
2. Slowly nudge and wiggle the parts you want taken off back and forth and you'll hear a light cracks. This is the glue breaking apart from the model.
3. Once the part is loose enough you can pull it from the model

The dorsal and ventral turrets can be removed by slowly twisting them to the left or right.
