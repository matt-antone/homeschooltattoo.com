I'm really excited about the X-wing Miniatures Phoenix Cell Squadron Pack that was released this month. I've watched Rebels through a couple of times now and since then have been wanting to do a repaint of my CR90. I've never done a repaint to any of my X-wing Miniatures, so why not start with a repaint and custom parts. What could go wrong?

My CR90 has seen better days. It's fallen off the shelf a couple of times. The stand pegs broke off. And the paint was scratched a bit. First up is repairing the pegs.
