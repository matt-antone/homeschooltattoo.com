## Background

I'm really excited about the X-wing Miniatures Phoenix Cell Squadron Pack that was released this month. I've watched Rebels through a couple of times now and since then have been wanting to do a repaint of my CR90. I've never done a repaint to any of my X-wing Miniatures, so why not start with a repair, repaint and custom parts. What could go wrong?

My CR90 has seen better days. It's fallen off the shelf a couple of times. The stand pegs broke off. And the paint was scratched a bit. It needed a lot of love.

## Build

First up was disassembling the model. I wanted to break the model into as many parts as possible for the repaint. Fortunately it's pretty easy.

1. Put the model in the freezer for 2 hours. This makes the glue the factory uses to become brittle.
2. Slowly nudge and wiggle the parts you want taken off back and forth and you'll hear a light cracks. This is the glue breaking apart from the model.
3. Once the part is loose enough you can pull it from the model

The sensor dish, dorsal and ventral turrets can be removed by carefully twisting them to the left or right until they are 90 degrees from their original position. Then just lift it out.

If you're asking me the Tantive IV was a diplomatic ship as opposed to the CR90's of the Phoenix Squadron. Their purpose was to wage war. So I took some measurements and then created turrets that look more like the battle ready TV versions of the CR90.

But why stop there? Might as well make some launchers too.

Here are the prints.

Painting was pretty straight forward. Some of the panels don't line up with my source, so I had to wing it a little.

Now put it all back together.
